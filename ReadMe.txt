The project objective is to harness the power of a Rapid API to source real-time stock market data and subsequently create a REST API for further processing. 
The intricate task involves categorizing the acquired stock data into key sectors such as 'Financial,' 'Oil & Gas,' 'FMCG,' and 'Healthcare.' 
To facilitate seamless real-time data management, the project leverages Kafka, ensuring efficient handling of dynamic market fluctuations. The AWS Lambda and Simple Notification Service (SNS) to trigger timely notifications. 
As the streaming data flows into DynamoDB, Lambda functions are invoked to assess the data status, and pertinent updates are promptly dispatched to the respective stakeholders via SNS. 
This intricate system not only streamlines the processing of real-time stock market data but also empowers key individuals with actionable insights, 
fostering informed decision-making in the ever-evolving financial landscape."
